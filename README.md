Computational Mechanisms of Pulse-Coupled Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Review

Pulse-coupled neural networks (PCNN) have an inherent ability to process the signals 
associated with the digital visual images because it is inspired from the neuronal 
activity in the primary visual area, V1, of the neocortex. This paper provides insight 
into the internal operations and behaviors of PCNN, and reveals the way how PCNN achieves 
good performance in digital image processing. The various properties of PCNN are categorized 
into a novel three-dimensional taxonomy for image processing mechanisms. The first dimension 
specifies the time matrix of PCNN, the second dimension captures the firing rate of PCNN, 
and the third dimension is the synchronization of PCNN. Many examples of processing mechanisms 
are provided to make it clear and concise.
